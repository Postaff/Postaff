# You may understand type Query as the index of graphQL schema
# Here we will define all the quries thats available to our graphQL server
# The first example we have here simply tell the graphQL that
# when we call query jobs, we're expecting an array of Job back
# We will then define the property of Job Type right below
type Query {
  jobs: [Job]
  schools: [School]
  subs: [Sub]
  subById(id: ID!): Sub
}

type Mutation {
  createJob(input: CreateJobInput): Job
}

# Here we're creating a query DataType for Job
# We're telling graphQL whenever we ask for Job, give us the follow fields.
# ! exclamation mark indicates the field cannot be null.
# graphQL is statically typed, we need to specify what type the field is going to be
# By default graphQL offers ID, Int, String, Boolean, Float.
